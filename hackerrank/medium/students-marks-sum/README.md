# Pointers in C

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given an array of integers, $marks$, denoting the marks scored by students in a class.

- The alternating elements $marks_{0}$, $marks_{2}$, $marks_{4}$ and so on denote the marks of boys.
- Similarly, $marks_{1}$, $marks_{3}$, $marks_{5}$ and so on denote the marks of girls.

The array name, $marks$, works as a pointer which stores the base address of that array. In other words, $marks$ contains the address where $marks_{0}$ is stored in the memory.

For example, let $marks = [3, 2, 5]$ and $marks$ stores *0x7fff9575c05f*. Then, *0x7fff9575c05f* is the memory address of $marks_{0}$.

**Function Description**   

Complete the function, *marks_summation* in the editor below.   

*marks_summation* has the following parameters:   

- *int marks[number_of_students]:*  the marks for each student   
- *int number_of_students:* the size of marks[]   
- *char gender:* either 'g' or 'b'   

**Returns**   

- *int:* the sum of marks for boys if $gender = b$, or of marks of girls if $gender = g$   

**Input Format**

- The first line contains $number\_of\_students$, denoting the number of students in the class, hence the number of elements in $marks$.
- Each of the $number\_of\_students$ subsequent lines contains $marks_{i}$.
- The next line contains $gender$. 

**Constraints**

- $1 \le number\_of\_students \le 10^3$
- $1 \le marks_{i} \le 10^3$ (where $0 \le i < number\_of\_students$)
- $gender$ = $g$ or $b$

**Output Format**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void update(int *a, int *b) {
    int temp = *a; 
    
    *a = temp + *b; 
    
    *b = temp - *b; 
    if (*b < 0) {
        *b = -(*b); 
    }
}

int main() {
    int a, b;
    
    // Read two integers
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    
    // Call the update function
    update(&a, &b);
    
    // Print the modified values
    printf("%d\n%d\n", a, b);
    
    return 0;
}

```
